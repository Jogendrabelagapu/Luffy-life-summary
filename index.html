    <h2>0 to 5 Years</h2>
    <p><strong>Monkey D. Luffy had an adventurous and eventful early childhood. Here's a summary of his life from 0 to 5 years:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Birth (Year 6XX):</strong> Luffy was born in Foosha Village, located on Dawn Island in the East Blue. His father, Monkey D. Dragon, is the leader of the Revolutionary Army, but Luffy was primarily raised by his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp, a Marine Vice Admiral.</li>
        <li><strong>Raised by Garp:</strong> Garp intended to mold Luffy into a strong Marine. From an early age, Luffy was subjected to intense and often dangerous training to toughen him up, including being left in the wild to survive.</li>
        <li><strong>Shanks and the Straw Hat:</strong> When Luffy was around 5 years old, he met Red-Haired Shanks and his pirate crew, who visited Foosha Village. Luffy admired Shanks and was inspired to become a pirate after hearing his stories. During this time, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi (a Devil Fruit) from Shanks' treasure, which turned his body into rubber but made him unable to swim.</li>
        <li><strong>Shanks' Influence:</strong> Shanks and his crew became a huge influence on Luffy's dream of becoming a pirate. In a pivotal moment, Shanks saved Luffy from a sea monster by sacrificing his arm, showing Luffy the true meaning of bravery. Before leaving the village, Shanks gave Luffy his iconic straw hat, asking him to return it when he became a great pirate.</li>
    </ul>
    <center><img src="child(0-5).png" alt="Luffy as a Child" width="290" height="350"></center>
    <p>By the age of 5, Luffy had already formed the dream of becoming the Pirate King and set out on a path to assemble his own pirate crew to explore the Grand Line.</p>

    <h2>6 to 10 Years</h2>
    <p><strong>These early years significantly shaped Luffy’s character and fueled his dream to become the Pirate King while highlighting the importance of bonds and perseverance in his life.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moved to Mt. Colubo:</strong> Luffy is sent to live with the bandit Curly Dadan on Mt. Colubo by his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp, to "toughen up." He meets Portgas D. Ace, Garp's adoptive grandson, who initially dislikes Luffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Sabo:</strong> Luffy meets another boy named Sabo, a fellow orphan with dreams of becoming a pirate. Together with Ace, the three form a strong brotherly bond and begin saving money to purchase a pirate ship.</li>
        <li><strong>Fighting and Surviving:</strong> Luffy undergoes grueling training to survive in the dangerous forests, often fending off wild animals and learning to fight.</li>
        <li><strong>Brothers' Bond:</strong> Luffy, Ace, and Sabo officially declare themselves brothers by exchanging cups of sake. They develop a strong connection, vowing to follow their dreams and protect each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Sabo’s Departure:</strong> Sabo, a noble by birth, is forced to leave after his family tracks him down. He tries to escape to the sea, but his ship is attacked by the World Noble. Luffy and Ace believe Sabo died in the attack, which deeply affects them.</li>
        <li><strong>Training Intensifies:</strong> Luffy continues training with Ace, learning to fight and developing his rubber-based combat techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Determination Grows:</strong> Despite the hardship, Luffy’s resolve to become Pirate King becomes unshakeable. He stays with Dadan and the bandits until he is ready to leave for his journey.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Ace Leaves Dawn Island:</strong> At the age of 17, Ace sets off on his own pirate journey, leaving Luffy behind. This motivates Luffy to grow even stronger, aiming to one day catch up to Ace. He feels lonely without Ace but also more determined to become the Pirate King.</li>
        <li><strong>Solo Adventures:</strong> Luffy spends his time training alone in the forests of Mt. Colubo, honing his combat skills, expanding his knowledge of survival, and preparing for his eventual departure.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation for Journey:</strong> Luffy remains in Foosha Village, planning his future journey and perfecting his fighting techniques. Though he still lives with Dadan and the bandits, his sights are set on leaving to start his own pirate crew.</li>
        <li><strong>Dreams Evolve:</strong> Luffy's dreams evolve as he trains, and he develops a deeper understanding of his powers and ambitions. He realizes that his goal is not just to find One Piece, but also to create lasting bonds with his crew.</li>
